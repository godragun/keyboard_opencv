# keyboard_opencv

## Overview

`keyboard_opencv` is a project that demonstrates how to use OpenCV to create a virtual keyboard interface. The application leverages computer vision techniques to detect and process user interactions, enabling users to input text or commands through a visual keyboard rendered on the screen.

This project is ideal for learning about:
- OpenCV GUI and drawing functionalities
- Basic human-computer interaction (HCI) concepts
- Real-time image processing

## How to Use

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Python (recommended version: 3.7+)
   - OpenCV library (`opencv-python`)
   - (Optional) Additional dependencies if specified in the code

2. **Installation**

   Install OpenCV using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

3. **Running the Application**

   Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/godragun/keyboard_opencv.git
   cd keyboard_opencv
   ```

   Run the main script (replace `main.py` with the actual entrypoint if different):
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Usage**

   - The virtual keyboard should appear in a window.
   - Use your mouse or finger (if using a touchscreen) to interact with the keys.
   - The application will display the detected key presses and may output the typed text.

## Customization

- You can modify the keyboard layout, colors, and interaction logic by editing the source code.
- Refer to OpenCV documentation for more advanced features.
